# README

Regrettably, we, the JLU OSTA (Open Source Technology Association of Jilin University), have been suspended since about 2018. 
It is not ashamed to tell you we failed. 
The glory of our wishes will not be extinguished, I believe that. 

If you would like to find someone who was related to this association, it is so sad to tell you that even I can not tell you certainty where they are now. 
Maybe @liuweiky, another leader of former JLU-OSTA, in our organization account is active in Github. 
I am the other, my account has been changed to @Umaru-Xi, or mail to umaru@umaru.science directly. 

Thanks for your tomb sweeping. 
Long live the source! 

很遗憾, 我们, 吉林大学开放源技术协会, 早在2018年即终止. 
我们坦诚自己的失败. 
但你我共同志愿的荣光必不会黯淡, 我相信. 

如果阁下期望寻找曾经与我们相关的人, 那么很抱歉地告知您: 在下也无法确切地奉告. 
或许我们的前主导人之一@liuweiky依然活跃在Github平台, 阁下可以在本账号的People中找到. 
在下是另一位前主导人, 但账号已经更换为@Umaru-Xi, 阁下可以直接致信umaru@umaru.science. 

感谢阁下前来祭奠. 
源必当永续!
