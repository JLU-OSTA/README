# README

Regrettably, we, the JLU OSTA (Open Source Technology Association of Jilin University), have been suspended since about 2018. 
It is not ashamed to tell you we failed. 
The glory of our wishes will not be extinguished, I believe that. 

If you would like to find someone related to this association, it is so sad to tell you that even I can not tell you certainty where they are now. 
Maybe @liuweiky, another leader of former JLU-OSTA, in our organization account is active in Github. 
I am the other, my account has been changed to @Umaru-Xi, or mail to umaru@umaru.science directly. 

Thanks for your tomb sweeping. 
Long live the source!
